Every time you want to obtain crypto currencies you have to make an account on an exchange and do all the required KYC which may take mupltiple hours and in some cases even days until its fully active. With CryptoToCash you can simply choose an offering and handle the transaction privatly without any KYC steps.

### CryptoToCash (ODEX - Offline Decentralized Exchange)

1) User A wants to sell coins for fiat. 
2) User A locks his coins in SMCT. 
3) User B wants to buy the coins for cash. 
4) User B registers his wallet address, locks his coins as collateral which equals the amount of the sellers coins (in stable coins or other too?) and shares contact information via Dapp. 
5) Seller and buyer agrees where to meet and how to exchange fiat for coins. 

The deposited amounts of both users will be locked for a minimum of 5 days. If User A don't want to wait, he can choose to get the locked colleteral from User B and User A gets the locked coins from User A. Therefore the transaction will be marked as finished.

The Dapp will list every available offering from every country and city. People who want cash for their coins can set offers and people who want crypto coins can agree to an offering. Contact Informations can be exchanged on the Dapp via a decentralized messaging app (Dust). After User A gets the promised fiat cash he then simply clicks on one button that transfers his coins to User B's wallet address. Everytime if a successfull transaction is accomplished both users trust score will increase and will be visible in the Dapp.
